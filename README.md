# python-programs

I am learning to program. This is the repository for my python programs.
Currently, I have two programs in my repo:

1. The password generator. I have added a level of complexity (for me) that allows you to select either the password will contain the numbers and special symbols.
2. The rock. scissors, and paper game.
